A trie data structure is implemented to store phonebook. The
names and contact numbers are given in file name_number.txt. If the user enters a
partial string, the program displays the number of matching contacts with entered
string as prefix (a string is prefix of itself) and top 5 matching contacts. One name can
be prefix of another name. The strings are case insensitive.
